\f0\fs32 \cf0 The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl\'a05. PCRE has its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API. The PCRE library is free, even for building commercial software.}]]></resource></locale></resources><requirements><requirement id="tosv" operator="ge" value="'10.4.0'"><message>This package requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later.</message></requirement></requirements><flags/><item type="file">01pcre.xml</item><mod>properties.title</mod></pkmkdoc>
