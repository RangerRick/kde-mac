\f0\fs26 \cf0 The JasPer Project is an open-source initiative to provide a free software-based reference implementation of the codec specified in the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard (i.e., ISO/IEC 15444-1). This project was started as a collaborative effort between Image Power, Inc. and the University of British Columbia. Presently, the ongoing maintenance and development of the JasPer software is being coordinated by its principal author, Michael Adams, who is affiliated with the Digital Signal Processing Group (DSPG) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Victoria.}]]></resource></locale></resources><requirements><requirement id="tosv" operator="ge" value="'10.4.0'"><message>This package requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later.</message></requirement><requirement id="filt" operator="eq" value="true"><file>/opt/kde4/lib/libjpeg.62.dylib</file><message>You must install LibJPEG for KDE before installing this package.</message></requirement></requirements><flags/><item type="file">01jasper.xml</item><mod>properties.title</mod></pkmkdoc>
