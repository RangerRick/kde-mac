\
It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.  (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)  So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.\
\
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.  To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.\
\
We are required to state that:\

\f0\fs32 \cf0 This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing "real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not exactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you have to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images, very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a low-quality image.}]]></resource></locale></resources><requirements><requirement id="tosv" operator="ge" value="'10.4.0'"><message>This package requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later.</message></requirement></requirements><flags/><item type="file">01libjpeg.xml</item><mod>properties.title</mod></pkmkdoc>
