Expat, Release 2.0.1

This is Expat, a C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark.  Expat is a stream-oriented XML parser.  This means that you register handlers with the parser before starting the parse.  These handlers are called when the parser discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed.  A start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may register handlers.

Expat is free software.  You may copy, distribute, and modify it under the terms of the License contained in the file COPYING distributed with this package.  This license is the same as the MIT/X Consortium license.

Versions of Expat that have an odd minor version (the middle number in the release above), are development releases and should be considered as beta software.  Releases with even minor version numbers are intended to be production grade software.
